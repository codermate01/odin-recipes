    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The choripan is a very popular argentinian recipe, you should definitely try it, there's nothing better than eating a choripan after playing football or after work.</p>
    <p>Is very simple to make it, just need a few ingredients and you're ready to taste one of the most flavorful dishes of Argentina.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

        <li>Bread, I recommend to get like a bolillo bread or something similar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it, that fundamentally what you need for a choripan, although you can of course add more things like for example: chimichurri, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise
        tomato, lettuce, garlic, onion, basically everything you want.
