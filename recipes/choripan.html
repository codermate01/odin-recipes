    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The choripan is a very popular argentinian recipe, you should definitely try it, there's nothing better than eating a choripan after playing football or after work.</p>
    <p>Is very simple to make it, just need a few ingredients and you're ready to taste one of the most flavorful dishes of Argentina. I <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommend using a grill, and burn <strong>real wood, not charcoal</strong>
     in order to have a more tasty choripan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chorizo</li>
        <li>Bread, I recommend to get like a bolillo bread or something similar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it, that fundamentally what you need for a choripan, although you can of course add more things like for example: chimichurri, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise
        tomato, lettuce, garlic, onion, basically everything you want.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the fire. While the wood is burning up burn your grill, this is going to melt the grease from recent uses, once the grease melted, take the grill off the fire and to clean it <em>latino style</em> use a piece of newspaper to clean the grease 
            <em>(Don't worry isn't toxic!)</em> </li>
        <li>One your wood has burned up and you have a lot of <a href="../images/firebrand.jpg"><em>firebrand</em></a><em>(I hope that's the right word)</em> apart the <em>firebrands</em> and make a layer of <em>firebrands</em> and rest the grill on top of the layer</li>
        <li>Now it's time to lay the chorizos on the grill, you have to cook them <strong>slow</strong>, that's the secret for the perfect choripan, patience. Try to not prick them, roll them with tongs. Cook them until there's little to no grease bubbling inside the chorizo.</li>
        <li>Almost the final step, once the chorizos have a brownish-golden color lightly toast the bread, the idea is to heat it and again <strong>lightly</strong> toast it, otherwise is going to be too dry. I recommend cutting the bread in the middle making sure to not cut entirely <strong>before</strong> putting the bread on the grill.</li>
        <li>Now put chorizo inside the pan and there you have it, a nice choripan. Now you can put some dressings, vegetables, tomatos, pickles or anything you like.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Enjoy it!</p>
