    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Making lasagna is pretty easy, to make it you can either use lasagna noodles that you can buy on a store or make it yourself.
        To accompany it you can use tomato sauce or Béchamel sauce, I suggest using both</p>
    <p>To make our lasagna we'll also use ricotta and ham slices to make it even more delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Bell pepper</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Ricotta</li>
        <li>Ham slices</li>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <p>We'll start making the tomato sauce (My mother used to call it "Red sauce" and she called Béchamel sauce "White sauce")<p>
    <li>First, chop the onions in cubes, put it in a pan with a little bit of oil on medium heat. Once the onion is transparent add the ground beef and chop some garlic cloves and the bell pepper and add it to the pan.
    Once the meat is cooked we can add the canned tomato sauce, oregano, salt and sugar. The sugar is just to kill the acidity of the sauce, so don't use too much.</li>
    <p>Now let's make the Béchamel sauce, we are going to need butter, milk, flour, salt, pepper and a nutmeg. The ratio is 50/50/500, 50 grams of butter, 50 grams of flour, 500 ml of milk</p>
    <li>Melt the butter on a pan, <strong>be careful it doesn't boil!</strong> we need it to be liquid, once is uniformly melted add the flour, and stir it with a spatula forming a thick paste.</li>
    <li>Now he have to add the milk slowly, in order to dissolve the paste evenly, it's a good idea to pour a little bit at a time until we have an homogeneous liquid on the pan. After adding the milk we have to add salt, pepper and a little bit of grated nutmeg.</li>
    <p>Finally let's make the lasagna</p>
    <li>On a rectangular baking pan we put a little bit of tomato sauce and a layer of lasagna noodles, on top of it we put a layer of sauce,ricotta, ham, and repeat it until you reach the top of your pan, lastly add a layer of noodles, grated cheese and bake it for 30~45 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
